                <h2 class="text-style">The Arabian gazelle is classified as a vulnerable species.
                    There are many environmental factors affecting the population density of Arabian Gazelles,
                    such as human hunting, predation, competition, and climate change.
                    The decline in population is due to human disturbances such as construction and illegal hunting.
                    The Arabian Gazelle is a species of gazelle native to the Middle East, specifically the Arabian and Syrian Deserts.
                    The UAE is taking the initiative to protect the Arabian Gazelle.</h2>
