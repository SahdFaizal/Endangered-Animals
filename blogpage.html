                <h2 class="text-style">The aerial survey for the Arabian Gazelle Protected Area,
                     carried out by the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) last November,
                     revealed a 22% increase in the number of Gazelle in the Protected Area,
                     in comparison to previous studies.
                     This confirms the success of the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed
                     Arabian Gazelle Reintroduction Programme which was launched in 2007
                     with a goal to relocate the Arabian Gazelle.
                     Initially there was a herd of no more than 160, and today,
                     the herd has successfully reached 946 heads.</h2>
                
                <h2 class="text-style">The survey also aims to increase the
                    available information on the age and gender composition
                    of the Arabian Gazelle herd. The data collected has helped
                    EAD establish a set of technical recommendations, with
                    the aim of improving the management of the reserves
                    and the re-introduction programmes for the Arabian
                    Gazelle as well as other species.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Khaldoun Al Omari, Section Manager-TPA
                    Management and Infrastructure and Maintenance in EAD,
                    explained: “The method of aerial surveys has been
                    adopted to count the Arabian Gazelle within the reserve
                    to ensure the largest possible coverage of the Arabian
                 Gazelle Protected Area, within the shortest time possible,
                    and to ensure that the results are accurate.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">“Additionally, the reserve was divided
                    into five different parts due to the size of the study area.
                    The study consisted of two phases, a preparatory phase,
                    which included the preparation of the study design
                    and the training of the participating team,
                    and the field phase, which lasted for four days.
                    The field phase involved carrying out 8 flights
                    at the rate of one and a half hours per flight.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Talking about the characteristics
                    of the Arabian Gazelle herd,
                    Al-Omari said: “A total of 83 young Arabian Gazelle
                    calves have been recorded, which accounts for 8.8%
                    of the total size of the herd. Also represented
                    in the herd in the reserve, include females who
                    formed the largest percentage of the herd size,
                    with a total of 76.5%.”</h2>
                
                <h2 class="text-style">It was recommended that the study
                    should be carried out once every three years, and the
                    current design of the study to be used to make the
                    necessary statistical comparisons and to assess
                    the status of the herds within the reserve.
                    Also discussed was the urgency of providing
                    periodic veterinary surveillance of the Arabian Gazelle
                    herd and to intervene in cases of necessity,
                    which are in line with international standard
                    requirements for the reintroduction programs.</h2><br>
