                <h2 class="text-style">The aerial survey for the Arabian Oryx Protected Area,
                     carried out by the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) last November,
                     revealed a 22% increase in the number of Oryx in the Protected Area,
                     in comparison to previous studies.
                     This confirms the success of the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed
                     Arabian Oryx Reintroduction Programme which was launched in 2007
                     with a goal to relocate the Arabian Oryx.
                     Initially there was a herd of no more than 160, and today,
                     the herd has successfully reached 946 heads.</h2>
                
                <h2 class="text-style">A specialist team from EAD conducted an aerial survey study
                    to count the number of Arabian Oryx,
                    Sand Gazelle and other species within
                    the borders of the largest natural
                    reserve in the UAE, which spans an
                    area of 6,000 square kilometers.
                    The survey conducted is part of
                    EAD’s commitment to preserving
                    biological diversity in Abu Dhabi
                    and protecting species in their natural habitat.
                    This project marks the second comprehensive aerial survey
                    for the Arabian Oryx Protected Area, with the first one 
                    taking place in March 2017.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">The survey also aims to increase the
                    available information on the age and gender composition
                    of the Arabian Oryx herd. The data collected has helped
                    EAD establish a set of technical recommendations, with
                    the aim of improving the management of the reserves
                    and the re-introduction programmes for the Arabian
                    Oryx as well as other species.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri,
                    Secretary-General of EAD, said: “This survey
                    is a major part of our efforts to preserve
                    the Arabian Oryx, under the hugely successful
                    Shaikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Arabian Oryx Reintroduction Programme.
                    Our leadership support to establish protected areas across emirate
                    has been fundamental to protecting species and biodiversity,
                    which were once on the verge of extinction. Arabian Oryx is
                    an iconic species of the desert landscape and a symbol of
                    our cultural heritage and was almost hunted to extinction
                    in the wild in the early seventies and only survived in captivity.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style"> “Thanks to extensive captive breeding of the
                    species undertaken by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan,
                    the species was saved. With this insight, he successfully launched
                    a programme to help preserve the Arabian Oryx, increase their numbers,
                    and relocate them for protection. His attention to the topic,
                    continuous support, and his farsightedness are the real reasons 
                    behind the recovery of the Arabian Oryx into the wild.
                    This project has become an example to be followed across
                    the world and represents great success for protection
                    and captive-breeding programmes.” </h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Her Excellency also attributed the next phase
                    of conservation action and success of the program to the leadership
                    and directions of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed,
                    to reintroduce the Arabian Oryx, as part of the Abu Dhabi government's
                    vision to establish the population of the Arabian Oryx within the region.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Ahmed Al Hashemi, Acting Executive Director
                    of the Terrestrial and Marine Biodiversity Sector in EAD,
                    commented: “Within the framework of His Highness Sheikh
                    Mohammed Bin Zayed's programme to translocate the Arabian Oryx
                    in the United Arab Emirates, there are now around 100 heads
                    in the Houbara Reserve, which is located in the Al Dhafra
                    region and managed by EAD.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Al Hashemi explained how the programme,
                    which has enhanced the position of the UAE on both regional
                    and international levels, is today considered one of the
                    most successful species conservation programmes in the world.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Al Hashimi added: “As a result of the efforts
                    of cooperation in the region and in coordination with international
                    environmental bodies and organizations, several countries were
                    able to increase the number of Arabian Oryx and reintroduce
                    them in a number of countries in the Arab region.
                    Through the General Secretariat for the Conservation
                    of the Arabian Oryx, hosted by EAD, these regional
                    efforts were crowned with unique success in 2011
                    when the International Union for the Conservation
                    of Nature, (IUCN) shifted the status of the Arabian Oryx
                    from an Endangered category to the category of Vulnerable.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Khaldoun Al Omari, Section Manager-TPA
                    Management and Infrastructure and Maintenance in EAD,
                    explained: “The method of aerial surveys has been
                    adopted to count the Arabian Oryx within the reserve
                    to ensure the largest possible coverage of the Arabian
                    Oryx Protected Area, within the shortest time possible,
                    and to ensure that the results are accurate.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">“Additionally, the reserve was divided
                    into five different parts due to the size of the study area.
                    The study consisted of two phases, a preparatory phase,
                    which included the preparation of the study design
                    and the training of the participating team,
                    and the field phase, which lasted for four days.
                    The field phase involved carrying out 8 flights
                    at the rate of one and a half hours per flight.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Talking about the characteristics
                    of the Arabian Oryx herd,
                    Al-Omari said: “A total of 83 young Arabian Oryx
                    calves have been recorded, which accounts for 8.8%
                    of the total size of the herd. Also represented
                    in the herd in the reserve, include females who
                    formed the largest percentage of the herd size,
                    with a total of 76.5%.”</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">Based on the survey,
                    the study concluded with a series of
                    recommendations, the most important
                    of which was to update the zoning
                    plan of the protected area in
                    proportion to the distribution
                    of the Arabian Oryx herds.</h2>
                
                <h2 class="text-style">A recommendation for a ground survey
                    of the reserve, based on the results of the current study
                    that is aimed at confirming the results of the aerial
                    survey was also proposed.</h2>

                <h2 class="text-style">It was also recommended that the study
                    should be carried out once every three years, and the
                    current design of the study to be used to make the
                    necessary statistical comparisons and to assess
                    the status of the herds within the reserve.
                    Also discussed was the urgency of providing
                    periodic veterinary surveillance of the Arabian Oryx
                    herd and to intervene in cases of necessity,
                    which are in line with international standard
                    requirements for the reintroduction programs.</h2><br>
